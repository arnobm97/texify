# texify

`texify` is a program for finding texts from images. I wrote the program as a university project. If you want then you can contribute to it. Currently the features that i added are -
- Search from *png, jpg,jpeg* files
- Search for all the letters and words
- Search for specific letters and words
- take the picture as a user input
